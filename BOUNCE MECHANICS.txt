BOUNCE MECHANICS
1. Add circle collider 2D and Rigidbody 2D to the target object
2. Set collision detection to continuous and interpolate  mode to interpolate
3. Create a new Physics material 2D and set the bounciness value to 1
4. Add new material to the rigidbody material slot
5. To adjust, change gravity scale or bounciness value
